# Christopher H. Todd's Python Library For Interacting With AWS

The ctodd-python-lib-aws project is responsible for interacting with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/language/python/). This includes interacting with DynamoDB, Lambda, S3, SNS, and SQS, and will be expanded in the future.

The library relies on Python's boto3 package which is used to communicate with the AWS APIs and warps the code with exception handling, logging, and other useful and redundant code.

## Example Scripts

Example executable Python scripts/modules for testing and interacting with the library. These show example use-cases for the libraries and can be used as templates for developing with the libraries or to use as one-off development efforts.

### N/A
## Notes

 - Relies on f-string notation, which is limited to Python3.6.  A refactor to remove these could allow for development with Python3.0.x through 3.5.x

## TODO

 - Unittest framework in place, but lacking tests
